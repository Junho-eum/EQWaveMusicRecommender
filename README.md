## EQ_based_rec_algorithm
- Music recommendation algorithm based on EQ soundwave
  - In the current age of streaming services, a personalized and efficient music recommendation system is of paramount importance. Existing methods typically rely on collaborative filtering, content-based features, and hybrid systems. This study introduces a novel approach using EQ sound wave pattern analysis to enhance the accuracy of music recommendations, aiming to provide a richer and more personalized user experience.
 
## Background and Related Work

- Previous studies have used a variety of methods for music recommendation, ranging from collaborative filtering, which bases recommendations on the listening habits of similar users, to content-based filtering, which recommends songs with similar features. This research aims to expand upon these methodologies by incorporating EQ sound wave analysis, a largely unexplored aspect in music recommendation systems.

## Methodology

- The proposed algorithm utilizes a dataset consisting of 20 songs from various genres, each represented by a 15-second EQ wave pattern recording of the intro section. We applied frequency-domain analysis to these recordings to develop a unique EQ sound wave 'fingerprint' for each song. The user's listening frequency for each song was used to train a machine learning model to predict their preference for similar EQ wave patterns.
